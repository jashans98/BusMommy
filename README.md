#### Never sleep through your bus stop again

### Inspiration

My commute to work this summer is an hour long bus ride on the GRT in Waterloo.
I tend to fall asleep a lot, and it's hard to figure out when I should be waking up.
I've tried setting timers and alarms, based on Google Maps estimates, but have still
slept through my destination a handful of times. 


BusMommy attempts to solve all of that: input your destination into the app, and it'll
wake you up when you're close to your location
